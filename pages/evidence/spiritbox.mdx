# Spirit Box

## Mechanics

- **Functionality:** The Spirit Box emits a constant static noise and can be toggled on (default: right-click). It listens for questions through voice or text-based UI. The microphone LED or icon indicates if it’s listening or receiving input.
- **Responses:** When a valid question is registered and conditions are met, the Spirit Box may give a response with a distinctive distorted voice. This serves as evidence. The result will show:
- **Positive Response:** White LED (Tier I), ghost icon (Tier II), white response LEDs (Tier III).
- **Negative Response:** Red LED (Tier I), 'X' icon (Tier II), red response LEDs (Tier III).
- **Interference:** During hunts or when disrupted by the ghost, the Spirit Box's LEDs flicker. Keeping the Spirit Box active within 7.5 meters of a ghost during a hunt will attract it to the player.
- **False Indicators:** Door touches, ghost events, non-response vocalizations, and unrelated flickering do not count as Spirit Box evidence.
- **Requirements for Evidence:**
    - The ghost must have Spirit Box as evidence.
    - The player should be in the same room and within a certain range (3-5 meters depending on the Spirit Box tier).
    - Room lights must be off, but equipment lights and lights in adjacent rooms don’t affect responses.
    - Some ghosts require the player to be alone; others can respond regardless of room occupancy.

## Tips

- **Early Usage:** Use the Spirit Box soon after locating the ghost room, as it requires remaining alone in the dark, reducing sanity and risking a hunt—this is particularly important on higher difficulties.
- **Clarity in Voice Recognition:** Ensure the voice recognition system is working correctly to avoid unregistered questions. Watch the microphone LED for input confirmation.
- **Static Management:** Turn off the Spirit Box when not in use, as its static can make it hard to hear subtle ghost activity.
- **Ghost Specifics:**
    - **Deogen:** Has a 33% chance of responding with heavy breathing if the player is within 1 meter.
    - **Moroi:** Curses the player upon a successful response, although the audio sounds normal.
    - **Effective Questioning:** Use recognized questions and remain patient, as there is a chance that the Spirit Box may not respond immediately, even if all conditions are met.
