# Ghost Orbs

## Mechanics

- **Appearance and Location:** Ghost Orbs are small, floating orbs that appear in the ghost's favourite room when the map loads. They move slowly and typically appear one at a time. They can only be seen using a Video Camera with night vision or a video feed with night vision. Night vision goggles (Tier III Head Gear) cannot detect them.
- **Detection through CCTV:** In some cases, Ghost Orbs can be spotted using a map's CCTV cameras if they are aimed into the ghost’s favourite room. However, this is rare and may not always be reliable.
- **Orb Movement:** Ghost Orbs will periodically shift their position within the favourite room, so players need to move around and adjust their camera angles to find them.
- **Room Changes:** On difficulties where the ghost can change its favourite room (such as Professional and Nightmare), the Ghost Orbs will relocate to the new room when this occurs.

## Tips

- **Use Multiple Cameras:** Place video cameras around the suspected ghost room to ensure coverage from different angles, as Ghost Orbs can move within the space.
- **Night Vision Check:** Always enable night vision mode when scanning for Ghost Orbs to improve visibility.
- **Be Patient and Observant:** Ghost Orbs may take some time to appear and can shift within the room. Spend a few minutes monitoring each camera feed to spot them.
- **Monitor CCTV Feeds:** Check the map’s CCTV feeds when available; they might provide a quick view into the ghost room and reveal Ghost Orbs without needing to set up a camera.
- **Room Relocation Awareness:** If the ghost changes its favourite room during gameplay, make sure to move your cameras and search again, as the Ghost Orbs will follow the ghost’s new location.
