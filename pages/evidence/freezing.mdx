# Freezing Temperatures

## Mechanics

- **Temperature Drops:**  A ghost's presence in a room will naturally cause the temperature to drop. For ghosts without Freezing Temperatures as evidence, the temperature can fall to around 1°C. However, if the ghost has Freezing Temperatures as evidence, it can lower the temperature to as low as −10°C.
- **Confirmation Thresholds:** Freezing Temperatures are confirmed when a thermometer reads strictly below 0°C. The Tier I thermometer is less precise between 5°C and 0°C, so it only confirms freezing if the reading drops below 0°C.
- **Gradual Changes:** Once a ghost leaves a room, temperatures do not instantly return to normal, meaning multiple rooms could remain cold or even freezing for a short while.

## Possible Ghosts

## Tips

- **Ghost Room Identification:** While Freezing Temperatures often indicate a ghost's primary location, they are not a guarantee that the ghost will remain in that room. Be cautious, as the ghost may move but leave behind residual cold spots.
- **Weather Influence:** If the fuse box is off, Freezing Temperatures might appear sooner, especially during cold weather like snow. This can lead to rapid cooling, sometimes within just a couple of minutes if the ghost stays in one place.
- **Roaming Ghosts:** Low temperatures can persist even after the ghost has left a room, so do not assume that the ghost is still present if the room remains cold.
- **Visual Cues:** While a ghost event involving an "airball" can resemble a player’s breath, it does not indicate low temperatures. The difference is that an airball moves toward a player, while actual cold breath remains stationary.
