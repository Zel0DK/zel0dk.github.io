# Ultraviolet

## Mechanics

- **Primary Uses:** UV Light reveals both fingerprints and footprints that are left behind when a ghost interacts with certain surfaces.
- **Rare occurrences:** Fingerprints on the exit door in Tanglewood, require very specific ghost behaviors (e.g., The Mimic mimicking a Yurei).
- **Interaction Surfaces:**
    - **Common Surfaces:** Most types of doors, light switches, windows, keyboards, TV remotes, cooler boxes, and mirrors (on specific maps).
    - **Prison-Specific Surfaces:** Bar surfaces of cell doors and keyholes.
    - **Maple Lodge Campsite & Camp Woodwind:** Lantern bases, tent door flaps, picnic benchtops, and string light poles.
- **Fingerprints:**
    - **Occurrence:** Typically left after the ghost interacts with a valid surface. Exceptions include the Obake, which has a 25% chance to hide fingerprints or create unique patterns.
    - **Patterns and Variations:** There are 18 fingerprint patterns, with three unique ones for the Obake. The Obake can leave:
    Six-fingered handprints.
    Multiple fingerprints on light switches, lamps, and remotes.
    More prints than usual on keyboards and cell doors.
    - **Duration:** Fingerprints fade out after 2 minutes (1 minute on Insanity difficulty). Custom difficulty can adjust this duration. The Obake may also reduce this time further.
    - **Consistency:** Fingerprints appear in consistent locations on doors and surfaces, with certain models always having fingerprints on specific sides (e.g., push vs. pull).
- **Footprints:**
    - **Salt Interaction:** If a ghost steps in a salt pile and moves within 10 seconds, it will leave footprints with each step. These fade within 10â€“15 seconds.
Appearance: Footprints are sometimes covered by furniture or carpets and can vary slightly in size based on ghost models (e.g., smaller footprints for the "tooth-faced" child ghost).

- **Photo Rewards:**
    - **Fingerprints:**
        - A photograph of fingerprints illuminated by a UV Light earns up to $5 and 5XP, labeled as "Fingerprint".
        - **Visibility:** Fingerprints must be visible and lit by UV Light; invisible or faded prints result in invalid photos.
        - **Repeat Photos:** Each distinct fingerprint can only be photographed once. However, interaction photos can be taken within 20 seconds of the fingerprint being left.
    - **Footprints:**
        - Footprint photos earn similar rewards, labeled as "Footprint". The UV Light must be illuminating them at the time.

## Tips

- **Quick Checks:** Use footprints as alternative UV evidence if doors aren't being interacted with frequently.
- **Coverage:** Be mindful of furniture and carpets that may obscure prints.
- **Photo Strategy:** Be swift when taking photos, as fingerprints and footprints will fade.
