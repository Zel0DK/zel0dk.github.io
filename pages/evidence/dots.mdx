# D.O.T.S Projector

## Mechanics

- **D.O.T.S State:** Ghosts with D.O.T.S evidence will occasionally enter a special state where a faint silhouette can be seen passing through the laser grid. This silhouette is only visible while the ghost is moving through the projection.
- **Ghost Behavior:** During the D.O.T.S state, the ghost will move towards the nearest player in the same room or to a random waypoint if no players are present.
- **Visibility:** The ghost's silhouette is visible to the naked eye, except in the case of a Goryo, which requires a video camera to be seen. Using a camera with night vision can improve visibility and help players spot the silhouette more effectively.
- **Tracking Multiple Evidences:** The D.O.T.S Projector can be used in tandem with a video camera to track both D.O.T.S and Ghost Orbs simultaneously, making it a valuable tool for evidence gathering.

## Tips

- Place the D.O.T.S Projector in high-activity areas, such as rooms where ghost interactions have been detected.
- For Goryo ghosts, ensure to use a video camera to spot the silhouette, as they cannot be seen with the naked eye.
- Position a video camera with night vision to improve the visibility of ghost silhouettes and catch them from a distance.
- Monitor the D.O.T.S grid while keeping an eye out for Ghost Orbs using a video camera to confirm multiple pieces of evidence simultaneously.
- Stay in the same room to increase the chance of the ghost moving towards you and passing through the D.O.T.S grid.
