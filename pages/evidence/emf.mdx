# EMF Level 5

## Mechanics

- **Chance of EMF Level 5:** For ghosts that have EMF Level 5 as evidence, any interaction with the environment has a 25% chance to trigger a Level 5 reading. This is different from more common readings like EMF Level 2 or 3.
- **How to Detect It:** To confirm EMF Level 5, use an EMF Reader around active areas where the ghost has been interacting with objects or manifesting. A Level 5 reading will show five solid lights on the device.
- **Significance of EMF Level 5:** Confirming this evidence is crucial for narrowing down the ghost type and advancing the investigation. It stands out clearly from lower EMF levels and provides a reliable clue in identifying the ghost.
- **Investigation Tip:** Scan rooms where activity is frequent, especially during events, to increase the chance of detecting Level 5.
