# Ghost Writing

## Mechanics

- **Interaction with the Book:** If Ghost Writing is one of the ghostâ€™s evidence types, the ghost may interact with an open Ghost Writing Book by lifting it and visibly scribbling inside. This interaction will not occur if the book is closed or outside the ghost's range.
- **EMF Reading:** When a ghost writes in the book, an EMF Level 2 reading will be triggered, with a 25% chance of producing an EMF Level 5 reading if the ghost has EMF Level 5 as evidence.
- **Writing Variations:** There are different types of writing that a ghost may inscribe in the book. Tier I and Tier III books can display three types of writing, while the Tier II book can show up to six types. The type of writing does not give any further clues about the ghost type beyond confirming Ghost Writing as evidence.
- **Multiple Books:** Each Ghost Writing Book placed can have different types of writing, but this does not affect gameplay beyond confirming evidence.

## Tips

- **Book Throwing:** If the ghost throws the Ghost Writing Book without writing in it, it does not have Ghost Writing as evidence. This may also indicate that the ghost is hiding its evidence type on Nightmare difficulty or higher.
- **Placement Matters:** Place Ghost Writing Books in the center of active rooms or near where the ghost has been interacting with objects for better chances of capturing writing.
- **Use Multiple Books:** Deploy several books around the room to increase the likelihood of ghost interaction, especially in larger spaces.
- **Monitor for EMF:** Have an EMF Reader nearby when checking the books to see if the writing triggers an EMF response, which can further help confirm evidence.
- **Capture Photos Promptly:** Take photos as soon as you notice writing in the book for maximum photo rewards, and remember that interaction photos can be taken within a short window after writing occurs.
