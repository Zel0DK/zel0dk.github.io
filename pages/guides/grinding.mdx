# XP Grinding

**Current Strat:** x12.97 Camp Woodwind

## Strategy
- The goal of this strategy is to go in long enough to survive a single hunt (2 if you value correctness over number of attempts) and leave. 
It requires a decent understanding of ghost behaviour during hunts and the ability to loop a ghost. This strat is done ideally with 2+ players,
but it is possible to do in single player.
- You will want to equip a loadout that at a minimum has incense (I prefer Tier 1 so the ghost will run away and not hang around), ignitors,
salt (preferably tier 2 or 3), and a device that can be left on to test for raiju (I usually go with an EMF reader or another device that will help complete an 
objective, such as a paramic).
- (Single Player) To start, grab the electronic device, turn it on and throw it just inside the gate (this will be used for testing for Raiju).
Then grab salt, an igniter, and an incense.
- (Multiplayer) Have one player grab an igniter and 2 incense and the other player grab salt, an electronic device (for testing raiju and/or completing objectives), and any other equipment
that could be used to complete other objectives.
- Head toward either the picnic tables just inside the gate or to the campfire in the middle of the logs. Place your salt on the ground in a location the ghost 
will likely walk through (opening to the campfire circle or in between the picnic tables). Then wait for the ghost to hunt.
- Once the ghost begins to hunt, start to identify what it is based on behaviour (footstep speed, flicker/blink rate, speed up near electronics, freezing breath, etc).
Continue to loop the ghost around the campfire / picnic tables and smudge if needed.
- **Note:** As of v0.9.2.0 the campfire no longer breaks line-of-sight.
- After the hunt is over, you can either use a timer to narrow down if it is a spirit or demon based on smudge cooldown (this takes quite a bit of time, but allows time to complete more objectives),
or you can guess the ghost and leave. This entire process can be done in under 2 minutes if optimized and rewards between 2000xp - 5000xp for correct ghost and completed objectives.
