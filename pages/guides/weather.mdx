## Blood Moon

## Fog

**Ambient Temerature:** 13°C

In this weather, vision is greatly reduced outdoors but fades off quickly near indoor areas.
This means that it doesn't impact indoor maps other than making outdoor security cameras difficult to use, 
but it does greatly decrease visibility on outdoor maps, such as Woodwind and Maple Lodge.

The ghost's vision is not impacted by foggy weather.

## Heavy Rain

**Ambient Temerature:** 8°C

Heavy rain brings very loud environmental noise which can make it difficult to hear many interactions.
The sound carries inside of many areas of various maps as the rain hitting the roof produces its own sound as well.
In addition to the heavy rain, this map also provides occasional flashes of lighting with accompanying thunder.
The thunder last for a couple of seconds and is loud enough that it can drown out all other sound, making it hard to track ghost footsteps or
hear equipment.

## Light Rain

**Ambient Temerature:** 8°C

Light rain provides some light environmental sound that is constant, but not usually loud enough to drown out the sound of equipment and
most interactions. It also does not extinguish nor prevent the lighting of firelights and igniters.

## Snow

**Ambient Temerature:** 5°C

Snow weather provides a light mist around the outdoor areas of the map which provides modest visibility, but is usually not
a hinderance to gameplay.
The lower ambient temperature means that if the breaker is off and a room has had time to cool down, you will be able to see
your breath in that room. For higher difficulties that start with the breaker off or broken, you will be able to see your breath in every
room inside the map. This can make it difficult to locate the ghost's current room as it masks a strong indicator of the ghost having
dropped the temperature in their immediate area.

## Sunrise

**Ambient Temerature:** 16°C

The sunrise provides much more additional ambient lighting, which greatly illuminates outdoor areas and any rooms where sunlight 
is coming through the windows.

## Windy

**Ambient Temerature:** 8°C

Windy weather has the same visibility and lighting as clear weather, but provides the additional environmental sound of wind
blowing through trees and the rustling of leaves. It is generally not loud enough to drown out the sound of equipment and
most interactions.
